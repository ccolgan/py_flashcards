"Explain closures", "A closure is an inner function that has access to an outer function's variables as well as global variables. The inner function also has access to the outer functions parameters.  A closure is created by including a function inside another function.", "JS"
"What is the difference between var, let, and const?", "Var is function scoped and let is block scoped. JS treats all variables as if they are declared (but not assigned!) at the top of a functional scope no matter where they are actually declared. This is variable hoisting. ES6 introduced block-level scoping which gives you more control over a variable's lifecycle. Variables declared using const cannot be re-assigned and therefore must be assigned when they are declared.", "JS"
